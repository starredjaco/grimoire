## Implementation Debt

Items that work but need structural improvements.

### concept:trivial-verifiability
- Enforced via PoC checklist but falsifiable vs verifiable framing absent from skill instructions
- See Priority Queue #7 for tasks

### concept:hypothesis-generation
- Partially reflected in PoC goal conditions and cartography exploration modes
- See Priority Queue #8 for tasks

### concept:backpressure
- Checks skill provides backpressure; no explicit enforcement mechanism in other skills
- See Priority Queue #5 for tasks

### infra:tomes
- Summon creates tomes/ directory; needs format guidance doc
- See Priority Queue #15

### infra:spellbook
- Summon creates spells/ directory; checks stores in grimoire/spells/checks/
- Needs user-facing explanation and management workflow (depends on scribe agent)

## Completed

- **skill:write-poc** — Production-ready. SKILL.md with Philosophy section, `user_invocable: true`, 5-step workflow with confirmation checkpoints at every step, vuln-class-to-reference lookup table in step 3. 10 reference files covering 7+ vulnerability classes. 4 worked examples (ssrf-curl, sqli-python, reentrancy-foundry, price-oracle-fork-test) demonstrating all 4 PoC approaches. scripts/validate-poc.sh for structural validation.

SKILL.md (6-step workflow with subagent decomposition for independent verification). references/cartography-format.md (symlink to cartography skill), references/overlap-detection.md (>40% threshold formalization, 3-tier overlap classification). examples/cartography-review-example.md (before/after review cycle with 4 common issues). scripts/validate-cartography.sh (frontmatter, sections, file existence, reciprocal link checks) + scripts/find-overlaps.sh (pairwise component comparison with configurable threshold). Full spec coverage, 0 debt.
- **skill:gc-cartography** — Production-ready. SKILL.md (6-step workflow with user confirmation gates) updated with explicit pointers to reference docs and explicit file paths. references/merge-decisions.md (decision framework: merge-when/keep-separate criteria, primary flow selection, ambiguous case handling) + references/overlap-metrics.md (overlap formula, 4-tier classification, subset detection, cluster detection, metric limitations). examples/gc-before-after.md (complete worked example: two overlapping vault flows merged with conditional section, cross-reference cleanup). scripts/detect-overlaps.sh (wraps review-cartography's find-overlaps.sh, adds subset/cluster detection and primary flow suggestion) + scripts/merge-flows.sh (structural merge: frontmatter union, section merging, conditional section generation) + scripts/update-references.sh (stale link replacement with reciprocal link checking) + scripts/validate-gc.sh (post-merge integrity: runs validate-cartography.sh, checks dangling references, verifies completeness). Full spec coverage (6/6), 0 debt.
- **agent:sigil (core)** — Single-context vulnerability hunter agent. `agents/sigil.md` with agent frontmatter (name, description with trigger phrases, tools: Read/Grep/Glob/Bash). System prompt covers three modes: Mode 1 (single sigil — 7-step hypothesis-driven hunt with GRIMOIRE.md consultation, check integration, finding output), Mode 2 (variant sigil — pattern generalization and full-codebase scan), Mode 3 (super sigil — stubbed, blocked on semgrep/slither skills). Strategy section covers hypothesis-driven hunting, check integration, external context via librarian, and scope discipline. Output format with per-finding detail and hunt summary. Constraints enforce evidence-only assertions, one-vector-per-invocation, benign payloads, parameterized targets. Familiar triage and scribe integration noted as future work. 16/24 spec requirements covered; 8 deferred to dependent components (summon spawning, familiar triage, scribe/gnome integration, super-sigil tooling). Remaining tasks: summon integration (#2), super-sigil (#5), familiar coordination (#6).
- **agent:librarian** — External research agent. `agents/librarian.md` with agent frontmatter (name, description with trigger phrases, tools: Read/Grep/Glob/Bash/WebSearch/WebFetch). System prompt covers two modes (directed question, generic study), 6-tier source priority (specs → repos → security KBs → audits → local grimoire → web), citation format, and constraints (no file mods, no code gen, citation required). Plugin.json updated with `"agents": "auto"`. Placeholder references updated in finding-draft, finding-review, checks, and finding-best-practices. context7/exa omitted (MCP services not bundled; WebSearch covers same ground). 12/16 spec requirements covered; 4 gaps are low-severity (familiar/autonomous-discovery agents not yet implemented, context7/exa are environment-specific MCP configs).
