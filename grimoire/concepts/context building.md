A lot of my security research time is spent tracking down flows. I start with a point of interest,
such as an intricate / complex mechansim performing sensitive operations. I review the mechanism and based 
on my understanding come up with things that could go wrong. I then investigate the different flows that 
interact with the given mechanism and see if the pre-conditions to my attack scenario can be met. 

There are two areas where an agent might aid me in this process. 

The one with the highest leverage is in identifying the flows that interact with the interesting mechanism.

LSPs are slow (esp. find references) and codebases can be constructed with tons of layers of abstraction. As 
a result a lot of time can get lost in navigating around, cross referencing, going back and forth, etc. 

The process of looking at control- and dataflow is actually quite straightforward and something that an agent can 
navigate quite well. Furthermore, an agent can handle abstract tasks like "please point out areas which perform auth checks".

### Progressive Disclosure / Knowledge Graph 

Callgraphs, dataflow graphs, etc are essentially just different relations between abstract components. An interactive 
graph can be leveraged by an agent to quickly navigate the codebase and identify the code that I want to have a look at w.r.t. any given flow. 

An lsp server exposes much of these relations and is likely sufficient to cover most usecases. 

### Context Building 

The idea of context building is to extend the existing knowledge graph exposed by an lsp with learnings and conclusions from the audit. 

For example, I might find out that a function does a specific check which covers a unique set of edge cases. I want to make a note with 
that conclusion to be surfaced in future investigations. The idea here is not to have the agent reason about these conclusions, it's just 
to have it surface these conclusions to me. 

The problem with asking the agent with reasoning or even coming up with conclusions is the phenomenon that continued reasoning diverges 
and that the ideas/ conclusions are not amenable to back-pressure.

That said, there might be a set of conclusions that are amenable to back-pressure. This is an interesting observation. For example, an 
agent might notice a certain function produces html code that's potentially vulnerable to xxs injection. This is an hypothesis that's 
easily testible by producing a small test case. 

### Gadgets

A phenomenon I have observed in my bounty hunting is that I collect a set of what I would call gadgets. 

The term is derived from the way that ROP-gadgets are used in binariy exploitation. Essentially, gadgets are tricks I found that 
allow me to have the code do something unexpected. Usually on their own these gadgets are benign, they might rise to the level of low 
severity issues, but often not even that. 

These gadgets are often essential in enabling critical vulnerabilies to be exploitable. 

I currently mostly keep a mental note about these, but it might be interesting to augment my workflow such that an agent indexes 
my gadgets and suggests them when I'm considering whether an issue can be exploited. 

It might even be useful to have the agent itself produce gadgets, or incorporate a gadget search in its proof of concept development workflow.

A nice thing is that gadgets are generally expressable as unit tests.
