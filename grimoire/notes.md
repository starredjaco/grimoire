# Grimoire Notes 

## Roadmap 

skills:
* triage 
* proof of concept   
* identify
    * maybe this skill needs to be split up (e.g. there could be a skill for building architectural context)
* context 
* scoping 
* flow
* back-pressure and automation
  * semgrep
  * codeql 
  * slither
* finding
* report 
* enscribe - build detection modules / knowledge base to help surface issues in future audits 

agents:
* sigil     (general sub-agent)
* sage      (back-pressure agent that double checks and gives a second opinion)
* librarian (fetches external documentation where relevant)
* imp       (reviews findings from external audits that might provide relevant information)
* scribe    (manages the personal spellbook)

grimoire:
* a guide about how to use the skills and agents that make up grimoire
    * this could also be a series of blog posts 

alchemy:
* set of tools and configurations around the skills and agents 
* I'm thinking about centering this around pi which is aimed at being extensible
* can build features like alloyed agents 

It might also be interesting to look at context engineering in relation to the skills and agents.

---

* many skill collections are opinionated and there is a learning curve 
* grimoire is essentially the same, but it would be good to enable compatibility, or look for ways to enable it

It would be nice to have an idea about how grimoire should integrate with external knowledge bases such as the research that has been done by kaden. 

Also, the scribe functionality is kind of close to something that you could build into an automatically learning agent pipeline. Something that just consumes the latest audit reports and potentially does a differential analysis to see how it needs to update itself to be able to detect the same bugs.

How does consolidation work between global scribe artifacts and local / project specific scribe artifacts?

I would like people to be able to change and or improve their local copy of grimoire so it adapts to their style of working. Not entirely sure how to structure that when grimoire is a plugin.

# Findings and Other Artifacts

There should be a directory where various artifacts can be put. Things like findings, static analysis modules and 
proof of concepts.

This should be in a git repository separate from the code under test. We should probably have claude point out on the initial
scope building that this is the case and that  if we're running within the git context of the system under test that the user 
might want to change directories / directory structure. 

```
findings/
detect/
poc/
tmp/ <-- for temp scripts / pocs that are being worked on
```


## Context and Delegation 

Context is really important and should be kept clean. 

As much as possible sub-agents should be used for different tasks and subtasks. 

For example a flow should be explored by a sub-agent with only the necessary context.


## Backpressure 

Only allow autonomy with back-pressure methods available. 

Example: Find me all locations where X happens
Back pressure: A semgrep module that actually finds all locations where X happens

You should never, ever, ask a completeness question to an agent that can not be backed up with a back-pressure skill. 

Example: Are all versions of this datastructure parsed correctly

This query lacks back pressure. The agent can not produce an artifact that ensures it actually checks all locations 
where a datastructure is parsed, or that it is parsed correctly. 

Improvement: Find all usages of this datastructure and check whether the version number in the parse function matches 
that of the usage function. 

This is better because the agent can distill this into a static analysis module. 

I've mentioned semgrep and static analysis twice. They're key unlockers in improving the reliability of agent co-auditors.

### Grimoire 

There should be a semgrep, slither and codeql skill. 

There should also be a back-pressure skill. This skill would mostly be about injecting a hook that ensures the agent applies 
back-pressure whenever possible. 

I think it might also be worthwhile to introduce a back-pressure agent that tries to do a soft "fact check" on queries that 
can not be backpressured. As it's simply not always practical to try to achieve back-pressure through static analysis.

Proof of concepts for findings are a great example of a task that naturally induces back-pressure.

## Progressive Disclosure and Context Building 

A lot of my security research time is spent tracking down flows. I start with a point of interest,
such as an intricate / complex mechansim performing sensitive operations. I review the mechanism and based 
on my understanding come up with things that could go wrong. I then investigate the different flows that 
interact with the given mechanism and see if the pre-conditions to my attack scenario can be met. 

There are two areas where an agent might aid me in this process. 

The one with the highest leverage is in identifying the flows that interact with the interesting mechanism.

LSPs are slow (esp. find references) and codebases can be constructed with tons of layers of abstraction. As 
a result a lot of time can get lost in navigating around, cross referencing, going back and forth, etc. 

The process of looking at control- and dataflow is actually quite straightforward and something that an agent can 
navigate quite well. Furthermore, an agent can handle abstract tasks like "please point out areas which perform auth checks".

### Progressive Disclosure / Knowledge Graph 

Callgraphs, dataflow graphs, etc are essentially just different relations between abstract components. An interactive 
graph can be leveraged by an agent to quickly navigate the codebase and identify the code that I want to have a look at w.r.t. any given flow. 

An lsp server exposes much of these relations and is likely sufficient to cover most usecases. 

### Context Building 

The idea of context building is to extend the existing knowledge graph exposed by an lsp with learnings and conclusions from the audit. 

For example, I might find out that a function does a specific check which covers a unique set of edge cases. I want to make a note with 
that conclusion to be surfaced in future investigations. The idea here is not to have the agent reason about these conclusions, it's just 
to have it surface these conclusions to me. 

The problem with asking the agent with reasoning or even coming up with conclusions is the phenomenon that continued reasoning diverges 
and that the ideas/ conclusions are not amenable to back-pressure.

That said, there might be a set of conclusions that are amenable to back-pressure. This is an interesting observation. For example, an 
agent might notice a certain function produces html code that's potentially vulnerable to xxs injection. This is an hypothesis that's 
easily testible by producing a small test case. 

### Gadgets

A phenomenon I have observed in my bounty hunting is that I collect a set of what I would call gadgets. 

The term is derived from the way that ROP-gadgets are used in binariy exploitation. Essentially, gadgets are tricks I found that 
allow me to have the code do something unexpected. Usually on their own these gadgets are benign, they might rise to the level of low 
severity issues, but often not even that. 

These gadgets are often essential in enabling critical vulnerabilies to be exploitable. 

I currently mostly keep a mental note about these, but it might be interesting to augment my workflow such that an agent indexes 
my gadgets and suggests them when I'm considering whether an issue can be exploited. 

It might even be useful to have the agent itself produce gadgets, or incorporate a gadget search in its proof of concept development workflow.

A nice thing is that gadgets are generally expressable as unit tests.

* detection agent / skill for rounding issues
    * detect places where rounding occurs
    * identify direction of rounding in favour of protocol
    * identify rounding amplification
