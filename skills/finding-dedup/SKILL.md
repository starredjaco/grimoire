name: Finding Dedup
description: >-
  This skill should be used when the user says "deduplicate findings", "dedup findings",
  "compare findings", "find duplicate findings", "merge findings", "clean up findings",
  "/finding-dedup", or wants to identify and resolve duplicate or overlapping security
  findings in a project. Classifies finding pairs as duplicate (can delete one) or similar
  (different scope, may merge). This skill is NOT for drafting new findings (use
  /finding-draft) or reviewing individual findings (use /finding-review).

# Finding Dedup

Identify and resolve duplicate or overlapping security findings.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, read `skills/finding/SKILL.md` to understand finding structure and
conventions. That skill defines the format and standards that this workflow relies on for
comparison.

## Workflow

When this skill is activated, create a todo list from the following steps. Mark each task
in_progress before starting it and completed when done.

```
- [ ] 0. Load finding knowledge (read skills/finding/SKILL.md)
- [ ] 1. Index and compare findings
- [ ] 2. Present duplicates and confirm actions
- [ ] 3. Execute and report
```

### 0. Load Finding Knowledge

Read `skills/finding/SKILL.md` to internalize finding structure and conventions. This is
required before proceeding — the base skill defines the format you will compare against.

### 1. Index and Compare Findings

Run the indexing script to get the full finding set:
```bash
bash skills/finding/scripts/index-findings.sh
```

If fewer than 2 findings exist, report that there is nothing to deduplicate and stop.

For each pair of findings, compare title, type, context (affected files), and description.
Classify each pair as:

- **Duplicate** — same root cause, same affected component, same impact. One can be deleted
  without losing information.
- **Similar** — overlapping root cause or component but different scope or impact. Cannot
  delete without information loss. May benefit from cross-referencing or merging.
- **Distinct** — no meaningful overlap. No action needed.

If the finding set is large (>10 findings), group by `type` first and only compare within
groups. Use subagents for parallel comparison if needed.

See `skills/finding/examples/dedup-scenario.md` for a worked example showing duplicate vs
similar classification and the resolution workflow.

### 2. Present Duplicates and Confirm Actions

Present results:
- Table of **duplicate pairs** with recommendation (which to keep, which to delete)
- Table of **similar pairs** with recommendation (merge, cross-reference, or leave as-is)
- List of **distinct findings** — no action needed

For each duplicate pair: *"Delete `<file>`? [y/n]"*
For each similar pair: *"Merge into `<file>`? [y/n/skip]"*

Never delete or merge without explicit user confirmation.

### 3. Execute and Report

Perform confirmed deletions and merges. When merging:
- Keep the more complete finding as the base
- Incorporate unique content from the other finding
- Present the merged result for user approval before deleting the source

Re-run the index to show the updated finding set:
```bash
bash skills/finding/scripts/index-findings.sh
```

Suggest `/finding-review` on any merged findings to verify quality.
